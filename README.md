## The Basic Idea
This is an ongoing exploration into **experimental interaction schema** for **spatial computing**.

***

### Current Exploration
I'm looking at creating an object and space based operating system, where every object can be turned into a **totem**, and spaces consist of groups of spatially organised objects. Spaces can also be **totemised**.

### Rationale
I want to create a spatial computing paradigm that is totally reliant on spatial memory and heuristic spatial creation.
